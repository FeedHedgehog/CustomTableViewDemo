# CustomTableViewDemo
自定义TableViewCell
hello，guys。My name is Jason Kiscy，and I'm a Chinese man.It has been 3 years since I graduated from school and now I work as a software Engineer with DONET.
When apple publish its new programming language Swift,I use my spare time to study the Swift,but after a wihle,I found that it is still hard to find a new job 
with Swift,So I make up my mind to study the OC first.So the first thing for me is to change my previous project code that was written with Swift to OC,so I start
the first functioning module----The custom TableViewCell which I call is the LuLuTableViewCell.
by the way ,my chinese name is 刘璐，and we can get in touch with each other with qq:1424870395 ,and I 'm the smiling cat.
